Ultrasound image processing for detection of worms inside humans

Two methods are adopted in order to process the ultrasound images of worms found inside humans:

1st Method: CNN based method to classify whether the images belong to the class of healthy or infected

2nd Method: Image processing techniques such as image enhancement and image segmentation are used to detect the worm
